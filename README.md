### Github Configuration 
There are three primary interfaces to Qubeship. 
  * Qubeship GUI application - Qubeship user interface access
  * Qubeship CLI application - Qubeship command line access
  * Qubeship Builder - orchestrates the Qubeship workflow

With open source Qubeship, you only have access to the Builder only. 

Qubeship manages authentication for all three interfaces through Github OAuth. This allows for single sign-on 
through Github identity management. The first time you use Qubeship, register the Builder 
as an 0Auth application in GitHub. You only need to do this once. 
 
To configure OAuth applications, enter the following information in GitHub OAuth:

#### 1. Builder:  
```
    Client Name : qubeship-builder
    Home Page : https://qubeship.io
    Description : Qubeship Builder
    call back URL: http://<docker endpoint>:8080/securityRealm/finishLogin
```
Copy and paste the client id and secret into the qubeship_home/config/scm.config 
in the variables **GITHUB_BUILDER_CLIENTID** and **GITHUB_BUILDER_SECRET**

#### 2. CLI: 
```
    Client Name : qubeship-cli
    Home Page : https://qubeship.io
    Description : Qubeship CLI client
    call back URL: http://cli.qubeship.io/index.html
```
Copy and paste the client id and secret into the qubeship_home/config/scm.config 
in the variables **GITHUB_CLI_CLIENTID** and **GITHUB_CLI_SECRET**

#### 3. GUI:  
```
    Client Name : qubeship-gui
    Home Page : https://qubeship.io
    Description : Qubeship GUI client
    call back URL:  http://<docker endpoint>:7000/api/v1/auth/callback?provider=github
```

Copy and paste the client id and secret into the qubeship_home/config/scm.config 
in the variables **GITHUB_GUI_CLIENTID** and **GITHUB_GUI_SECRET**

### Other Configuration Entries

#### 4. GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_HOST:
This is the url for the Github SCM instance to be used with qubeship. Qubeship will use this system as the defacto identity manager for Qubeship authentication , as well as use this for pulling the source code for builds. if this is left blank, the GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_HOST will be defaulted to https://github.com
Qubeship currently supports only http(s):// . SSH is in pipeline. 

```
GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_HOST  =   # no trailing slashes , only schema://hostname
```
#### 5. SYSTEM_GITHUB_ORG:  
This denotes the default system  organization for Qubeship. All users with membership to this org will be considered admin users for that Qubeship instance.   
![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qubeship/bootstrap/master/GithubORG.png)  
if this is left blank, the installers personal github org will be used as default.  

```
SYSTEM_GITHUB_ORG  =  # if left blank , default will be install  users personal github org
```

### Config File Example

This is what the config file looks like:
```
#optional - use only for onprem github : format : https://github_enterprise_host (no trailing slash)
GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_HOST=

# required
SYSTEM_GITHUB_ORG=
# Qubeship GUI client Authentication Realm
GITHUB_GUI_CLIENTID=
GITHUB_GUI_SECRET=
# Qubeship CLI client Authentication Realm
GITHUB_BUILDER_CLIENTID=
GITHUB_BUILDER_SECRET=

```
/install.sh --help
Usage: install.sh [-h|--help] [--verbose] [--username githubusername] [--password githubpassword]  [--organization orgname] [--github-host host ] [--install-registry] [--install-target target_cluster_type]  [--install-sample-projects]
    --username                  github username

### Post Install - viewing services deployed to qubeship
In order to view the services deployed via qubeship, you will have to take some special steps. This is necessary because the local kubernetes installation doesn't give access to services over standard endpoints. As a one time setup effort, you have to run this from the bootsrap directory.
```
  qubeship_home/bin/kube-service-patch.sh
```
Step 1: determine your service name:
    this is the container prefix of your project.
    `kubectl get services`
```
NAME                             CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
kubernetes                       10.0.0.1     <none>        443/TCP          3d
qubefirstpythonproject-service   10.0.0.63    <none>        443/TCP,80/TCP   2h
```

Step 2:
use the access_qubeservice utilty to figure out your service url  
```
qubeship_home/bin/access_qubeservice.sh qubefirstpythonproject-service /api
qubefirstjavaproject-service
IP address of the qubefirstjavaproject-service-service : 10.0.0.63 for api
curl http://10.0.0.63/api
{"api": "hello world"}
```
