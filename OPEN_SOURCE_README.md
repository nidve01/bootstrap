## Configure Qubeship

### How to Determine Your Docker Endpoint
Your Docker Host is where Qubeship resides. Use this endpoint to configure Qubeship OAuth applications in GitHub. 

    * Is your Docker Host running locally? 
        Your Docker Endpoint is 'localhost'

    * Is Docker Running on a virtual machine or docker machine?
       Use the following command:
       ```
       $  docker-machine ip
       ```
    
    The result should be an ip address that you can use as your Docker Endpoint. 
    
    * Is your Docker host on a remote machine? This "machine" is usually a Docker Swarm cluster. 
       ```
       $ echo $DOCKER_HOST | awk '{ sub(/tcp:\/\//, ""); sub(/:.*/, ""); print $0}'
        ```

### Github Configuration 
There are three primary interfaces to Qubeship. 
  * Qubeship GUI application - Qubeship user interface access
  * Qubeship CLI application - Qubeship command line access
  * Qubeship Builder - orchestrates the Qubeship workflow

With open source Qubeship, you only have access to the Builder only. 

Qubeship manages authentication for all three interfaces through Github OAuth. This allows for single sign-on 
through Github identity management. The first time you use Qubeship, register the Builder 
as an 0Auth application in GitHub. You only need to do this once. 
 
To configure OAuth applications, enter the following information in GitHub OAuth:

#### 1. Builder:  
```
    Client Name : qubeship-builder
    Home Page : https://qubeship.io
    Description : Qubeship Builder
    call back URL: http://<docker endpoint>:8080/securityRealm/finishLogin
```
Copy and paste the client id and secret into the qubeship_home/config/qubeship.config 
in the variables **GITHUB_BUILDER_CLIENTID** and **GITHUB_BUILDER_SECRET**

#### 2. CLI: 
```
    Client Name : qubeship-cli
    Home Page : https://qubeship.io
    Description : Qubeship CLI client
    call back URL: http://cli.qubeship.io/index.html
```
Copy and paste the client id and secret into the qubeship_home/config/qubeship.config 
in the variables **GITHUB_CLI_CLIENTID** and **GITHUB_CLI_SECRET**

#### 3. GUI:  
```
    Client Name : qubeship-gui
    Home Page : https://qubeship.io
    Description : Qubeship GUI client
    call back URL:  http://<docker endpoint>:7000/api/v1/auth/callback?provider=github
```

Copy and paste the client id and secret into the qubeship_home/config/qubeship.config 
in the variables **GITHUB_GUI_CLIENTID** and **GITHUB_GUI_SECRET**


### Config File Example

This is what the config file looks like:
```
#optional - use only for onprem github : format : https://github_enterprise_host (no trailing slash)
GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_HOST=

# required
SYSTEM_GITHUB_ORG=
# Qubeship GUI client Authentication Realm
GITHUB_GUI_CLIENTID=
GITHUB_GUI_SECRET=
# Qubeship CLI client Authentication Realm
GITHUB_BUILDER_CLIENTID=
GITHUB_BUILDER_SECRET=
# Qubeship Builder Authentication Realm
GITHUB_CLI_CLIENTID=
GITHUB_CLI_SECRET=
```

### Github Security
- we need the github username and password credentials to perform the qubeship initialization steps. this is only collected in the install process to generate intermediate oauth tokens using https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth_authorizations/ and is used for non-interactive qubeship logins during the setup process. The user name / password credentials so collected are discarded at the end of the installation process.  
After initial setup , Qubeship uses OAUTH authentication as described in https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/.
